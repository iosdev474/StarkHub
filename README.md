# StarkHub

Tony Stark, our beloved Avenger is worried about content restrictions being imposed by
YouTube. Being a futurist he is senses a threat, that one day YouTube might have full control
over all the video content. Inspired from BitTorrent, he thought of a Peer to Peer streaming
service with features similar to YouTube. Tony is too busy while making his new bleeding
edge armor. So he needs your help to create this platform while he prepares for a bigger
threat.
PS. The team with best implementation of this software will get Stark Internship ;)
